<p>
  I'm a software developer who also enjoys taking photos; this site is for
  showing off some of my favourite shots. Perhaps one day I will sell prints
  from here, perhaps one day there will still only be a couple of mediocre
  images because I have magpied my way onto the next shiny thing that takes my
  interest.
